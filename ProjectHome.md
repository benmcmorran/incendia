Incendia is a firefighting game developed for [OGPC 4.0](http://techstart.org/ogpc) by PHRED TO.0. It took 1st place in the independent division at the competition.

The basic premise of Incendia is that a small fire has started in a local building in a modern city. After building personnel fail to extinguish the fire and evacuate, the fire department is called. Firefighters, including the player, soon arrive on the scene and attempt to stop the fire while rescuing victims still trapped inside.

The goal of Incendia is to rescue people from a burning building while preventing damage by using a variety of tools and techniques to fight the fire. Rescue has priority over preserving structures. As the game progresses, the fire continues to spread throughout the building and gain intensity. Occasionally the fire will reach something highly flammable and there will be an explosion. If you don't rescue everyone fast enough, then you loose the level. Bonus points are awarded for preventing excessive damage to the building.

One neat feature of the game is that levels are loaded at run-time from text files in the levels directory using a simple file format. This system makes it easy to modify preexisting levels or create new ones.

The game is designed to raise awareness of firefighting search and rescue techniques, as well how to be prepared for a fire.
